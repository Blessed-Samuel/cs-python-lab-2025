This repository contains my Python assignments and practice projects.

## Assignment 1: Basic Calculator
A simple calculator program that:
- Accepts two numbers from the user
- Accepts a mathematical operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Performs the operation and displays the result

### Example
```bash
Enter first number: 2
Enter second number: 5
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): *
2 * 5 = 10
