# 📱 Python OOP Assignment

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python using practical examples.  
It covers:

- Creating custom classes with attributes and methods
- Using constructors (`__init__`) to initialize objects
- Applying inheritance to extend base classes
- Exploring polymorphism where the same method behaves differently across classes

---

## 🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class

I designed a **SmartPhone** class with attributes such as:

- `brand`
- `color`
- `storage`
- `battery_life`

And methods including:

- `make_call()`
- `send_message()`
- `battery_lifespan()`

An extended class (**iPhone**) was created to demonstrate **inheritance**, adding a unique method `take_shots()` for camera functionality.

## 🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge (Smartphone Version)

Polymorphism was demonstrated with different smartphone classes implementing the same method take_shots() differently:

iPhone → Taking portrait photos 📸
Samsung → Taking wide-angle photos 🌄
Google Pixel → Taking night-sight photos 🌙

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
